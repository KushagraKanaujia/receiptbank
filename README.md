## 🚀 The Problem

Your data is valuable. Every day, tech giants profit billions from YOUR personal information - your preferences, habits, and behaviors - **without your consent and without compensating you**.

DataHub is changing that.

## 💡 The Solution

DataHub is the first **open-source personal data marketplace** that puts YOU in control:

- **Own Your Data**: Connect 26+ services (Spotify, Fitbit, Instagram, Amazon, and more)
- **Choose Your Buyers**: Approve or decline each business request individually
- **Earn Passive Income**: Make $50-$200/month just by sharing data you're already generating
- **Complete Transparency**: See exactly who wants your data, what they'll use it for, and how much they'll pay

### Why This Matters

- 🌍 **Data Rights**: You generate it, you should profit from it
- 💰 **Fair Economy**: Businesses get quality, consented data; users get compensated
- 🔒 **Privacy First**: You control who sees what, with enterprise-grade encryption
- 🤝 **Open Source**: Transparent, auditable, community-driven
